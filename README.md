# Authentication
 Made an application for authentication from scratch using passport js and Google OAuth 2.0 for encryption. The main functionality that the project have is that,
 an user can register, the account is saved into database(MongoDB) and then the user is redirected to the page and the account is remembered by the google browser
 and the user doesn't need to login again untill he empty's the cache from google, because of the cookies and session that has been implemented.
